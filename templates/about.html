<h1>About This Site</h1>

<section style="max-width: 800px; line-height: 1.6;">

    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
        I'm Finlay Anderson, a Computer Science student interested in software engineering,
        problem solving, and building practical systems and just engineering/technology in general. I enjoy taking core computing concepts
        and turning them into small working applications rather than leaving them as theory.
    </p>

    <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
    <p>
        This website is designed as a lightweight portfolio demonstrating my understanding
        of backend development fundamentals using Flask. Instead of a purely visual project,
        I wanted to build something that shows logic, validation, and clear reasoning.
    </p>

    <p>
        The binary converter is intentionally simplistic - the focus is correctness, clarity,
        and structured code rather than complexity. Each conversion shows the working steps
        to reflect how the algorithm actually operates.
    </p>

    <h2>What It Demonstrates</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flask routing and templating</li>
        <li>Form handling and validation</li>
        <li>Separation of frontend and backend logic</li>
        <li>Readable, maintainable code structure</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Additional number system conversions (hexadecimal, two’s complement)</li>
        <li>More small tools demonstrating algorithms</li>
        <li>Improved UI styling and usability</li>
        <li>AI explanations (attempted to be added but currently locked behind paywall)</li>
    </ul>
